\chapter*{Abstract}

Queues with scheduled arrivals occur frequently in society, most notably in health care. These are queues where customer arrival times are scheduled in advance. In this thesis, we study both static and dynamic schedules. A static schedule is fixed for the duration whereas a dynamic schedule is chosen progressively during service. Dynamic schedules reflect the ability of a scheduler to reschedule customer arrival times during service. In this thesis, we compare the two schedules both in terms of expected behaviour and by use of a simulation study.
