\chapter*{Declaration}

This thesis is the sole work of the author whose name appears on the title page and it contains no material which the author has previously submitted for assessment at the University of Melbourne or elsewhere. To the best of my knowledge and belief, the thesis contains no material previously published or written by another person, in the form of unacknowledged quotations or mathematical workings or in any other form, except where due reference is made. I declare that I have read, and in undertaking this research I have complied with, the University's Code of Conduct for Research. I also declare that I understand what is meant by plagiarism and that this is unacceptable.
